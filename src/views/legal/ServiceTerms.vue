    <h4>The Website includes the following Services:</h4>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>DSP Providers</b>: An online database displaying DAPP Service
          Providers (“<b>DSPs</b>”) and the DAPP Service Packages (“<b
            >Service Pack</b
          >”) they offer. This Service and the information displayed by it, is
          based on data uploaded and updated by third parties on the EOS
          blockchain, collected through API’s.
        </p>
        <p>
          EOS Nation does not review the DSP Providers content for accuracy,
          does not review content for completeness or reliability, and does not
          warrant or guarantee the accuracy, completeness, reliability or any
          other aspect of any DSP Providers content.
        </p>
        <p>
          DSPs are independent unrelated third parties and any interaction
          and/or transacting with them is at your own risk and responsibility,
          after exploring and understanding the applicable terms governing DSPs
          operation and the specific services they are offering.
        </p>
        <p>
          EOS Nation makes no representation or warranties whatsoever, nor does
          it provide any recommendation or advice with respect to the DSPs
          and/or Service Packs (all or any part thereof).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Select Service Packages</b>: Using the DSP Providers, you can
          select the Service Packages you wish to use or the DSPs you would like
          to support. Once you have made your selection, should you wish to
          submit your selections via the Services and execute the “stake” action
          of your relevant DAPP Tokens for the selected DSPs and/or Service
          Packs, you will be asked to log in to your Wallet (as defined herein).
        </p>
        <p>
          Once logged in to your Wallet, the relevant parameters (i.e. the
          parameters of your selected DSPs and/or Service Packs) will be fed to
          your Wallet, which in turn should create the applicable command line.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please make sure you carefully review the command line created by your
          Wallet, and that it reflects your desired actions, before you execute
          it (approve and send to the EOS blockchain) via your Wallet.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When Using Services <b>(under sections b above)</b>:</p>
        <p>
          Please make sure you carefully review the command line created by your
          Wallet, and that it reflects your desired actions, before you execute
          it (approve and send to the EOS blockchain) via your Wallet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, you should make sure you understand the terms, conditions and
          associated risks applicable to using blockchain technology in general,
          and the EOS blockchain and DAPP Network specifically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that these Services are only available for use with a
          blockchain wallet or API which is supported by the Services as may be
          updated from time to time (“<b>Wallet</b>”). In early stages, the
          Services are intended to support Scatter, an EOS compatible wallet.
          Wallets, including Scatter, are made available by unrelated
          third-party service provider. Your use of your Wallet is at your own
          risk and responsibility and subjected to each Wallet supplier’s
          applicable terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          EOS Nation makes no representation or warranties whatsoever, nor does
          it provide any recommendation or advice with respect to Scatter or any
          other Wallet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Select Service Packages are not the only ways to perform the
          desired actions, but rather just a way to assist you to create a
          relevant command you can than execute with your Wallet. You can choose
          to use any other EOS wallet, or any other way of transacting with the
          DAPP Network on the EOS blockchain, at your sole and complete
          discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend you should make sure you fully understand the applicable
          terms and conditions relating to DSPs, Service Packages and the DAPP
          Network, before using your DAPP Tokens (relevant information may be
          found on the LiquidApps).
